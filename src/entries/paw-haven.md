**The problem:** Most dog adoption galleries in Singapore are outdated with information overload and poorly-presented dog profiles. This results in missed opportunities for potential adopters to connect with these animals.

**The solve:** Create a more friendly and approachable UI for dog adoption galleries to increase foot traffic to adoption centers and help more dogs find homes.

## Dog Gallery
A visually appealing display of available dogs with their names and photos, complemented by a basic filter mechanism to help users narrow down their search.

  <video autoPlay loop muted playsInline src="/assets/entryAssets/paw-haven-3.mp4" alt="A screenshot of a website. There is a dark blue navigation on top, with the 'Gallery' page selected. Title: Adoption Gallery. Subtitle: Our furry companions eagerly await their chance to bring endless joy to cozy and welcoming homes. If one of our stories tug at your heartstrings, a little love tap on the [heart] is all it takes. When you're ready to make memories together, that same [heart] on the top-right is your ticket to setting up a meet-and-greet. Below this there is a yellow filter button, with a bunch of selected options on the right: female, HDB Approved, and vaccinated. There is a small text which says showing 5 of 42 dogs. The remaining page is a three column by two row grid, with a total of 5 dogs. Each cell has a dog photo, the dog's name, and a grey heart. One of the cell's heart is red instead of grey.">
