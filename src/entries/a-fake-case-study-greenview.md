## Introduction
For 2023 I was hoping to do some experimenting with [view transitions](#), but they didn’t seem quite ready for me yet. So the ol’ thinking cap went back on.

I’ve had a couple responsive ideas floating around in my head for a few years. The first was maybe you could get some version of the site only while you’re resizing the browser. It could be a hidden world briefly revealed if you know to resize (and luckily I’ve been encouraging people to do that for years). The second was maybe you could get different versions of the site depending on whether you were resizing the browser larger or smaller. It opens up some cool possibilities if a growing site doesn’t have to be just the reverse of a shrinking site.

## Concept and Inspiration
Here in our neck of the woods, we begin looking for bumblebees in early February and expect to see them actively working until temperatures drop in the late fall. This year is unfolding differently. Only a single bumblebee explored my yard in early spring and for the past month or so, only a few have randomly appeared to check out my garden. Although that makes my daughter and granddaughter happy, it deeply concerns me. You see, our native bumble bee populations are in serious decline.

## Growing/Shrinking
 Bumble bees, like so many of the world’s pollinators, face a myriad of other challenges. Habitat loss, climate change, non-native invasive plants and animals and widespread pesticide use all threaten their existence and threaten to leave yet another hole in our fragile environmental web. As much as I would like to be able to, as one individual I cannot reshape the world  But I can do my part – even if its just teaching a six year old not to bee afraid!

 Bumble bees are the only native bees to live in colonies.  All other native bees are solitary insects. Bumble bee colonies tend to be small, with only 50 to 500 bees living there at a time, Honeybee colonies usually range closer to 50,000 individuals at any given time. Bumble bees tend to nest in holes in the ground left by other burrowingbumble nest animals. Other than the newest queen, bumblebee colonies die out when temperatures begin to drop in the fall. The young queen slips into hibernation mode for the winter. The next spring, if conditions  are favorable, she will emerge and start a brand  /new colony. Unfortunately, overly exuberant spring cleaning often destroys the nests which are typically quite close to the surface. Once disturbed, the new queen dies and one fewer colony begins. 

## Color themes
Unlike the honey bee which traveled from tropical Africa to Asia to Europe before being brought to the east coast of the United States in 1622, our bumble bee species are native pollinators who have evolved alongside native plant material. On one hand, bumble bees tend to be generalists, visiting a wide array of flowering plants in their daily search for pollen and nectar. 

## Conclusion
Depending on the source consulted, there are currently between 45 and 49 species of native bumble bees left in the United States. The number of bumble bees buzzing throughout the garden however, has dropped dramatically –as many as 1 out of every 2 bumble bees have disappeared from the landscape.  One of the most common, and far-reaching species, the American Bumble Bee, is facing imminent extinction. They have already disappeared from 8 states across the country. Researchers with the Xerces Society and the North American Bumble Bee Specialist Group, put another 11 common species at risk for extinction too.
