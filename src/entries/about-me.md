Hello, I'm Hoi Cheng, a 27-year-old Product Designer from Singapore. I find joy in helping people make sense of today's technology by creating comfortable and easy-to-use experences.

I've dabbled in a bunch of things, fuelled by my personal curiosity. This has been so impactful for me to learn new things and acquire knowledges across disciplines. I have a intrinsic want to build the things I design, which led me to pick up web development at my own time.
