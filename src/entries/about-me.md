##  Introduction

Hello, I'm Hoi Cheng, a Product Designer from Singapore.

I discovered about product design when I first took a course on game design during university. Inspired by my professor’s passion for storytelling and learning the power of interactivity, it didn’t take long for me to see the potential of product design as a way to reach people and help them navigate life through the software tools they use.

I find joy in helping people make sense of things by creating experiences that are comfortable and easy to use. No one should feel left behind just because technology isn’t intuitive.

## My First Professional Experience
After graduation, I began my career at a tech consultancy working on Greenview Portal, a tool used by hotel staff who aren’t tech enthusiasts. I loved making their work easier. I stayed there from early 2019 to the end of 2023, leading design from end to end and learning from both successes and failures.

## Learning to code
While I was working on Greenview Portal, programming was always a mysterious black box. After three years of relying on others to bring my designs to life, I wanted to unlock that black box myself. So, I started looking into web development through The Odin Project, learning just enough to create, build, and test my ideas.

This led me to check off a big item on my bucket list: owning my personal space on the internet by building my own portfolio website from scratch. You're looking at it right now.

## Life beyond the screen
Outside of work, I relax by being active outdoors, surrounded by nature, animals, and the people I love. 

When I have more time, I take it to go on adventures. This year, I climbed outdoors in Kuala Lumpur’s Batu Caves, swam into a fish cave in Siquijor, and saw my first shark during a night dive in Tioman.

I'm looking forward to climbing the Jade Mountain in Taiwan this October.
