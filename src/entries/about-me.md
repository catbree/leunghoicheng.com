Hey there, I’m Hoi Cheng, a product designer based in Singapore with experience working as a design team of one. I’m passionate about simplifying complex problems to create comfortable experiences that simply make sense. Outside of work, you’ll probably find me outdoor climbing, exploring underwater caves, or unwinding in Stardew Valley. Thanks for dropping by!
